# FINTECH DATA POOL

## Summary
A large volume of data is being generated on a continuous basis because of the massive growth of interconnected devices and the social websites. The increasing volume of data creates new challenges to data ingestion systems. One important task is to collect, ingest and integrate data from many sources into an analytics platform. The goal is having a meaningful and unique data pool that potentially possess high commercial value.

This project will get the daily data stock price from Yahoo Finance, a reliable API source, Coinbase for cryptocurrency, and Twitter tweets through Twitter API. From these two data sets, we want to see the connection between the tweets from the news as well as industry leaders and the stock prices in the two years.
